# DO NOT USE THIS FOR A DB YOU CARE FOR AS THERE IS NO AUTHORIZATION, PROTECTIONS, AND SAFETY CHECKS FROM ANYONE WITH ACCESS RUNNING A "`DROP *`" WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS EXERCISE.

this was a learning exercise for SQL (sqlite3 specifically), JS and FLASK.

this was envisioned as an internal tool to be used as both a SQL table viewer for table information, and as a learning tool to help new devs learn how SQL statment querries that feature aliases, as well as allowing intranet access for devs to be able to ~~easily~~ make SQL statements on a server from any terminal without the need for a physical keyboard for the most part.

it is a mess of JS, it is extremely ugly, and i would completely rewite this from the ground up again to be used in an actual work enviornment

but it works ~~kind of~~ 

and i learned alot doing this exercise, and that was the whole point.
